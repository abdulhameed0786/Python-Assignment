    "# Qno.1: Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:\n",
    "    Object Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.\n",
    "     In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit characteristics from other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It has four main pillars that are given bellow:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.Inheritance:\n",
    "         A feature that represents the \"is a\" relationship between different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.Encapsulation:\n",
    "         The process of combining elements to create a new entity. A procedure is a type of encapsulation because it combines a series of computer instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.Abstraction:\n",
    "         The process of picking out (abstracting) common features of objects and procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.Polymorphism:\n",
    "         A programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.\n"

    "# Ans: \n",
    "### A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",
    "### A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:\n",
    "    1.\tA method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
    "    2.\tA method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).\n"

    "### 2.\tObject\n",
    "### 3.\tAttribute\n",
    "### 4.\tBehavior\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:\n",
    "## 1.\tClass: \n",
    "        A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behavior associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class.\n",
    "   #### The example for class can be:\n",
    "            class Parrot:\n",
    "                pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here, we use class keyword to define an empty class Parrot.\n",
    "## 2.\tObject:\n",
    "\n",
    "        An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The example for object of parrot class can be:\n",
    "\n",
    " \t\tObj = Parrot()\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Here, obj is object of class Parrot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.\tAttribute:\n",
    "### There are two types of Attributes:\n",
    "### a) Instance attribute:\n",
    "        An instance attribute is a Python variable belonging to one, and only one, object. This variable is only accessible in the scope of this object and it is defined inside the constructor function, __init__(self,…), of the class.\n",
    "### b) Class attribute:\n",
    "        A class attribute is a Python variable that belongs to a class rather than a particular object. It is shared between all the objects of this class and it is defined outside the constructor function, __init__(self,…), of the class.\n",
    "#### For Example:-\n",
    "            class Example(object):\n",
    "                class_attr = 0\n",
    "                def__init__ (self, instance_attr):\n",
    "                    self. instance_attr = instance_attr\n",
    "•\tinstance_attr is an instance attribute defined inside the constructor.\n",
    "•\tclass_attr is a class attribute defined outside the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.\tBehavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "            Behavior is a work that is performed by an Object. For example, an object has a person with a name property, age, address, etc., with behaviors like walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or an email with properties like recipient list, subject, body, etc., and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.\n",
    "#### Behavior in a class is Method \n",
    "##### For Example:\n",
    "            class Parrot:\n",
    "                def __init__(self,name):\n",
    "                    self.name = name\n",
    "                \n",
    "                def up_name(self,NewName):\n",
    "                    self.name = NewName\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Where def __init__(self,name ): is instantiation method and def up_name(self,NewName): is name updating method \n"
